# Interpolation_And_Curve_Fitting_Model
## Description
In curve fitting, the given points can be treated as one chunk that fits one polynomial, or small chunks, each to be fit into a different polynomial.

## Features
Curve Fitting And Interpolation:

- Open and display an CSV signal such 
- choose numbers of chuncks of signal.
- Choose the order of the fitting polynomial
- The fitted equation and percentage error are shown in its mathematical form above the main graph
- The extrapolation efficacy,choose 50%,60%...of signal to apply this
- Can generate an error map for the fitting process
- Choose the x- and y- axis of the error map among number of chunks, order of the fitting polynomial, and overlapping between consecutive chunks.
